# 📒✨ Tales from a Not-So-Organized Blogger Life ✨📒

Welcome to our Dork Diaries-Inspired project! 🌸 This website aims to capture the fun, sketchy teen-spirit of Dork Diaries by offering a variety of small interactive minigames, each accessible via buttons on the main gamehub page.

## 🌟 Project Overview

Our project is a playful website heavily inspired by Dork Diaries, where users will be able to explore a virtual world filled with games and other activities. Each game is meant to be fun and interactive. 🖋️📚✨


### 🎲 Website Features 

- 💖✨ Title Page: The title page has various cards (images) that relate to dork diaries and fit the webpage theme. If you click on one of these cards, a quote will pop up that relates to the card and/or gives advice. This is what our blogger board is all about.
