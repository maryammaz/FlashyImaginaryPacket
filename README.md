# 📒✨ Flashy Imaginary Packet ✨📒

Welcome to our Dork Diaries-Inspired project! 🌸 This website aims to capture the fun sketchy spirit of Dork Diaries by offering a variety of small interactive games, each accessible via unique icons across the site. 🌈💖

## 🌟 Project Overview
Our project is a playful website inspired by Dork Diaries, where users will be able to explore a virtual world filled with games, activities, and more. Each game is meant to be something fun when looking for what to do. 🖋️📚✨

### 🎲 Features and Ideas
- 🎨 Icon-based Navigation: The main page will consist of various icons, each leading to a different mini-game or activity. These icons will have a spin on the Dork Diaries aesthetic. 💖✨
- Mini Games: We’re plan to create a collection of small, exciting games with themes that may be inspired by the characters and stories in Dork Diaries. 💕

### 💻 Technologies Used
- HTML: To create the website structure and add styling and design with a Dork Diaries theme. 🌼🌟
- We are not sure if we will use java yet.

### 🌈 Future Plans
