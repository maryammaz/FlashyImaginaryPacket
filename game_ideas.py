# Brainstorming Game Ideas:

# Main Idea: A game where you are a blogger and need to gain blogger points to be a top journalist. It is dork diaries inspired and the html website will reflect that.
# 4 or 5 minigames that give blogger points and maybe can unlock different types of articles.
# Can choose name
# Log in credentials like the games he showed us
# If we an, add sparkles to the mouse pointer.






### 1. Tic-Tac-Toe game
# Theme: It could be customized with touches relating to the series, like using cute doodles or character icons (ie. hearts in place of X).
# For Variation, we could have single player mode where players could compete against AI. The other option would be multiplayer mode.
# Design: We could style the backdrop with bright, on theme colors and doodle-like borders to capture the essence of Dork Diaries.

### 2. Mini-Puzzle Game 
# Simple puzzles with images related to dork diaries, which can be pieced together in either hard or easy mode.

### 3. Doodle Art Game
# A digital space to draw with different color options and brush sizes. Players could create designs and save them or clear to start over.

### 4. Match the Character Game 
# A memory card game with pairs of Dork Diaries characters and their accesories (?). 
# Goal: find matches to complete the game.
